This project classifies a valid image into two categories
1. Cricket
2. Football

"In this project, I have taken the data(i.e. images) from web so the dataset is small, as a result it has 100 % accuracy on test dataset."
"The dataset is created with the help of dataset pipelining from tensorflow library."
"The model used to classify photos is convolution neural network"
"Future suggestion- instead of small dataset a large no of data can be used to train the model so that it provides better accuracy on unknown data"
